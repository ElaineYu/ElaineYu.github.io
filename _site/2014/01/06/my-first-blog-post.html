		With the profileration of smart-phones, wi-fi hotspots and , there is endless potential to create interesting applications. 

		In September 2013 I officially became a Dev Bootcamp Student in Chicago and became a newly minted graduate late December. 
		Dev Bootcamp -- it's very existence, shows the amazing power of human community to respond to needs. 

		I've decided to wait and let the dust settle and blog after Dev Bootcamp so I wouldn't sound like an overly exhausted or hystericial schoolgirl during my 12 weeks of intense coding.  while in the grind of 12 hour days for the 12 weeks that I coded.  While it was strongly encouraged to blog about our expereinces during Bootcamp, I was much too focused on coding to have the preparation or temperament to write cohesively. 


		I'll try to carefully construct some of the highlights here:

<h1> Why Dev Bootcamp?</h1>

<h1> Applying</h1>

		I kind of enjoyed and was surprised by my friend's reactions when I got into the program:

<h1> Learning Process</h1>
	<p class="blog-content-text">


	A lot of my learning, well...just sort of happened.  
	Dev Bootcamp wasn't just about becoming proficient Ruby on Rails coders, but improving on our inner lives.
	</p>


	Devbootcamp is an ecosystem of loveable talking creatures.  Each cohort was assigned an animal name, like Banana Slugs, Squirrels and Otters.  I started out as a Coyote and decided to repeat a phase and transitioned into a Salamander.  I was officially a "Co-mmander" (which is a pretty darn sweet name for wolfish-reptile mutant).

	Dev Bootcamp does something which I've never see anyone else do: create job opportunities for.

<h1>The Phases (and repeating a Phase) </h1>

	</p>

<h1>Pair Programming</h1>
	<p class="blog-content-text">
		Let us cross another a gulf of mutual incomprehension together!  Well, not quite. 
	</p>

<h1>The Love</h1>
	<p class="blog-content-text">
		I can say for sure that I loved Dev Bootcamp very much.  Dev Bootcamp certainly wasn't easy, but I'm already bathing in wistful nolstagia for the incredible individuals I met and for the hard-core learning.  Instructor bios on Dev Bootcamp's website do no justice to their amazing personalities.  My bootcamp teachers and the incredibly zen, gentle, humorous Dave Hoover will remain legendary in my heart.   After graduation, I think my cohort somewhat felt that without each other we would descend into vegetative hopelessness and lonely decreiptude. 

		We shared the joy of our company and drank in merriment upon graduation (well, at least for me, as much as Asian alcohol tolerance could allow -- about 7 tablespoons of burbon).

<h1> Life after Dev Bootcamp</h1>
	<p class="blog-content-text">
		I'm admitted cleaner and well slept.

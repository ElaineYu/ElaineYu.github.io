The only part of pair programming in a learning environment like DevBootcamp that I did not enjoy was suffering the feeling of uncertainty of whether I could write code on my own.  I tend to be a pretty cerebal, independent person and to work on the same computer taking turns writing code was at times extremely difficult.

		Here's a quick reference guide to Github commands I learned at Dev Bootcamp. When starting out, I found nice to have commands uncommitted to memory yet on hand.  I hope this is useful for Dev Bootcamp Phase 2 students and for  beginners.  
	</p>

<h1> 1. Create a repo</h1>

<h1> 2. Add collaborators/team members</h1>
		<p class="blog-content-text">
		Go to "Settings" and add collaborators. 
		</p>


<h1> 3. Team member should clone the repo to their respective computers.</h1>

<h1> 4. Always work on a branch</h1>
	<p class="blog-content-text">
		In your terminal, 
	</p>	

	<p class="blog-content-text"> Your branch name ("branch_name" outlined here) can be called anything you like</p>


<div class="terminal-commands">
	<ul>
		<li> $ git branch <div class="comments">Show all branches you've created</div></li>

		<li> $ git checkout -b <strong>branch_name</strong> <strong>(create a new branch) </strong> </li>
	 
	 	<li> $ git checkout <strong> branch_name </strong> (transfer from branch to branch) </li>
	 
 	 </ul>
</div>


<h1>5. Add and Review Your Changes. Commit Early and Often</h1>
	 	<p class="blog-content-text">
	 		As a rule of thumb, it's good to commit early and often as possible.  For example, anytime you edit a particular section of code, commit it to GitHub.  This makes it easier to "time travel" and go back to a specific commit and undo changes if necessary. 
	 	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li> git add .  add all your changes </li>
	  <li> git commit  -m (See folder, add comments, save, close, done!) <li>
	  <li>git push origin branch_name (push branch up to repository so you can update it </li>
 	  <li>git commit - make edits commits - No push </li>
 	 
 	  <li>git push origin branch_name (push this from local up to branch repo, never do it to master!)</li>
 	 </ul>
<h1>6. Pulling changes from another team member's branch </h1> -->
